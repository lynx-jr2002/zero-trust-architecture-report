A detailed report on Zero Trust Architecture with components, deployment models, and future directions
# Zero Trust Architecture – Academic Report

Hi there! I'm a Cybersecurity undergraduate at **SLIIT**, and this is my detailed academic report on **Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA)**. This report was submitted as part of the **IE2022 – Introduction to Cyber Security** module in my second year.

## About This Report

This report explores the **evolution, core principles, and implementation** of Zero Trust Architecture—a modern security model that assumes *no trust by default*, even inside a corporate network.

It was written with the goal of:
- Understanding the shift from perimeter-based security to ZTA
- Exploring how organizations can practically implement ZTA
- Highlighting future enhancements with **AI and Cloud** technologies

---

##  Key Topics Covered

- Limitations of perimeter-based security
- Rise and evolution of Zero Trust
-  Core principles & logical components (PE, PA, PEP)
-  Deployment models and strategies
-  Use case scenarios in enterprise environments
-  Integration with AI and cloud-native architectures
-  Future directions in Zero Trust

---

##  Files Included

- `ICS.pdf` – The full academic report (SLIIT, Year 2 Sem 1)
---

##  References

This report was developed by referring to multiple scholarly sources, with the **NIST SP 800-207: Zero Trust Architecture** framework as the primary reference.

Other resources include:
- IEEE & Hindawi journal articles
- Case studies on AI-powered Zero Trust
- Practical guides on ZTA in cloud environments
